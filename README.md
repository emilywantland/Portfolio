* CIS 250 provides an introduction to the role of computers and other information technologies in business. Basic concepts covered were computer use with special attention to current technological innovation in social and business environments. Topics included technology and organizational change, telecommunications, privacy in the information age, and business security on the internet. Sessions in the computer lab emphasized business problem solving using critical thinking techniques and commonly used analytical tools.
* CIS 300 covered the study of computer information systems as they support business processes. Topics included the role of data, data manipulation, database management, information management and decision making, systems analysis and design, historical vs. current methodology in data communications, hardware and software in telecommunications, an overview of automated information systems, policies and procedures needed to protect an information system, and advanced use of spreadsheet and database software.
* Excel and Access files are included that display data manipulation skills. 

### Database Design

This folder contains files from **CIS 310: Database Design**
* CIS 310 provided a solid and practical foundation for the design and implementation of database systems. Emphasis was on relational database models, with significant coverage of basic relational database concepts, normalization, E-R modeling, locking, SQL, and distributed databases. Additional topics included web databases, database security, access control policies and procedures, risk management, and ethical aspects of information handling. Course software included current database tools such as SQL server.
* Visio files are included that display data models such as entity-relationship models. In additon, documents that display a grasp of database concepts are included.

### Event-Driven Serverless Computing

This folder contains files from my role as a professional software developer. 
* The .CS files included are from C# projects I completed from start to finish. They use existing structure and syntax created by the Director of Development. 

### Information Security

This folder contains files from **CIS 480: Introduction to Network Security** and **CIS 481: Introduction to Information Security**
* CIS 480 covered basic concepts of networking, operations security, protocol features for security, transmission security, packet filtering, TCP wrappers, firewalls, computer viruses, physical protection, legal protection, liability issues, significance of National Security Directive 42, implications of the Computer Security Act, CERT recommendations, assessment of threats and vulnerabilities of systems, security countermeasures, contingency planning, disaster recovery, risk management, and auditing and monitoring, policies and procedures dealing with storage and disposition of sensitive data.
CIS 481 covered basic notions of confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication models, protection models, security kernels, audit, intrusion detection, operational security issues, physical security issues, security system life cycle management, personnel security, policy formation and enforcement, trust modeling, risks and vulnerabilities assessment, basic issues of law and privacy, trade secrets, employee covenants, copyright, database protection, software and hardware validation, verification and certification.
* The CIS 480 folder contains various lab and homework files that display an understanding of the aforementioned concepts. 
* The CIS 481 folder contains group assignments that display a grasp of the concepts and an ability to work as a team. In addition, the final project report and presentation display collaborative proficiency. 

### Resume

This folder contains an up-to-date copy of my professional resume.

### Software Development

This folder contains files from **CIS 199: Software Development I** and **CIS 200: Software Development II**
* CIS 199 introduced object-oriented concepts such as the use of classes, methods, encapsulation, and inheritance. The course concentrated on using object-oriented programming to solve simple problems involving input and output. Computer lab sessions reinforced programming concepts. 
* CIS 200 emphasized object-oriented software development. We studied the object model and applied it to systems development problems. Topics included polymorphism, inheritance, and object interaction. Event-driven programming of graphical user interfaces was introduced. Application areas included data structures, searching, sorting, and databases.
* Each folder contains zip folders with program and lab files in their entirity. Each lab or program folder contains relevant files, photos of the output or result, and instructions for context. 

### System Development

This folder contains files from **CIS 420: CIS Development Project**
* CIS 420 is a continuation of CIS 320, this course focused on the detailed design and implementation phases of the system development life cycle, including user acceptance testing, test planning, design reviews, and change procedures. Specifications created in CIS 320 were used to implement, test, and install a working version of an information system. System deployment emphasizes a web-based architecture. A prototyping approach was taken to develop and test the system in an iterative manner.
* This folder contains assignment documents and presentations. System files will be added upon completion.

### Systems Analysis and Design

This folder contains files from **CIS 320: Systems Analysis and Design**
* CIS 320 introduced the fundamentals of object-oriented analysis and design, including experience with a CASE tool. Topics included requirements determination, feasibility analysis, modeling with Unified Modeling Language (UML) and data dictionary construction, data modeling and normalization, user interface requirements specification, and information security procedures. Development of problem and design specifications for an information systems project was required. Developed team skills, written and oral communication skills.
* This folder contains course assignments, presentations, and iteration and specification documents.

### Web Development

This folder contains files from **CIS 411: Web Application Development**
* CIS 411 introduced dynamic web applications and how they are developed. Topics included the role of client-side and server-side technologies, and use web forms, various server controls and session objects to develop multipage web applications. Gained system development experience with current web development tools and platforms.
* This folder contains relevant project files for development assignments. In addition, the final project folder contains images from a banking website developed within the course. All relevant files to the project are included.
