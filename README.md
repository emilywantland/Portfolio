* The CIS 481 folder contains group assignments that display a grasp of the concepts and an ability to work as a team. In addition, the final project report and presentation display collaborative proficiency. 
* The CIS 483 folder contains various lab and homework files that display an understanding of the aforementioned concepts. 
* I served as the team leader in CIS 481. I assigned and compliled my group member's sections. I selected the project topic, provided research, created the presentation, and edited the report. Editing the report required major rewrites and a multitude of drafts. 

### Resume

This folder contains an up-to-date copy of my professional resume. 
* A subfolder includes diplomas from UiPath Training courses.

### Software Development

This folder contains files from **CIS 199: Software Development I** and **CIS 200: Software Development II**
* CIS 199 introduced object-oriented concepts such as the use of classes, methods, encapsulation, and inheritance. The course concentrated on using object-oriented programming to solve simple problems involving input and output. Computer lab sessions reinforced programming concepts. 
* CIS 200 emphasized object-oriented software development. We studied the object model and applied it to systems development problems. Topics included polymorphism, inheritance, and object interaction. Event-driven programming of graphical user interfaces was introduced. Application areas included data structures, searching, sorting, and databases.
