What do I need to include in the project?
1. Two master pages: one for the pages available to public, one for secure pages (can only access after log in).
2. Log in page: use the user data (user name and password) stored in tblLastNameUser to log in and add adequate validation controls. Show the username and password on the page for grading. 
3. Secure page: To show that you are logged in.
4. Three pages: Manage User, Manage Customer, Manage Loans. Make sure add adequate validation controls.
	• Manage User Page: use formview to manage user information, including editing, deleting, adding, etc. 
	• Manage Customer Page: use gridview to show customer information and formview to manage data. 
	• Manage Loan Page (have not covered in current video yet): use dropdown list to select customer, use label to show monthly payment, use gridview to show loan information, use formview to edit loan information, use gridview to show amortization schedule. 
5. SQL database: includes at least three tables: tblLastNameUser; tblLastNameCustomer; tblLastNameLoan, link the primary key and foreign key between tblLastNameCustomer and tblLastNameLoan. Add at least 5 “fake” data in each table. 
6. CSS: Add adequate CSS features to make the application authentic.
7. User Experience: Make sure you make the application easy and pleasing to use for users. 
8. Something New: Add something new in addition to the features you learned in class. Also, I encourage you add more pages to your application, such as: About us page, contact us page, social media, etc.

P.S. CSS, UI, Something new are not included in the class demonstration, those are expected to be added by you.
